# Chatterbox
A simple chat app built with React.js and Socket.io.

## Running it

First, grab the dependencies:

    npm install

Initiate server with Node and Webpack:
  
  In terminal window 1:

    webpack-dev-server

Navigate to `localhost:8080/app` in multiple tabs and chat away! Note that as you open/close new tabs, users are automagically connected/disconnected.
